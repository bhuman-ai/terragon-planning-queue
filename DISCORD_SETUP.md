# Discord Notifications Setup for Meta-Agent

The Meta-Agent will send Discord messages to your specified channel whenever it needs your input during autonomous task execution.

## ðŸš€ Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Create Discord Webhook
1. Open your Discord server
2. Go to the channel where you want notifications
3. Click the gear icon (Edit Channel) â†’ Integrations â†’ Webhooks
4. Click "New Webhook"
5. Give it a name like "Meta-Agent Bot"
6. Copy the Webhook URL (looks like: `https://discord.com/api/webhooks/123456/abcdef...`)

### Step 2: Add to Environment Variables
Add this to your Vercel environment variables:
```
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL_HERE
```

### Step 3: Deploy
Deploy to Vercel and you're done! ðŸŽ‰

## ðŸ“± How It Works

1. **Task Execution**: When you approve a Meta-Agent proposal, the task begins autonomous execution
2. **Decision Point**: If the AI encounters something requiring your input, it pauses the task
3. **Discord Alert**: You receive a Discord embed message with:
   - Task title and ID
   - What decision/input is needed
   - Direct link to resume the task
4. **Resume Task**: Click the link in Discord to provide input and continue

## ðŸ”§ Testing Discord Notifications

Test the Discord endpoint directly:

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-deployment.vercel.app/api/notifications/discord \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "message": "Test notification from Meta-Agent",
    "taskId": "test-123",
    "taskTitle": "Test Task",
    "urgency": "normal"
  }'
```

## ðŸŽ¨ Discord Message Format

All Discord messages from Meta-Agent appear as rich embeds:
- **Blue embed**: Normal notifications
- **Red embed**: Urgent notifications requiring immediate attention
- **Fields**: Task name, ID, and direct resume link
- **Timestamp**: When the notification was sent
- **Footer**: Meta-Agent branding

## ðŸ”’ Security Notes

- Discord webhooks are secure and rate-limited
- Each notification includes a unique task ID
- Resume links include authentication
- Webhooks can be revoked anytime from Discord

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

If you're not receiving Discord messages:
1. Check Vercel logs for notification attempts
2. Verify DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL is set correctly
3. Test the webhook URL directly in Discord
4. Check if Discord channel permissions allow webhooks
5. Look for rate limit errors (Discord allows 30 messages/minute)

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips

1. **Dedicated Channel**: Create a dedicated #meta-agent channel for notifications
2. **Mobile Notifications**: Enable Discord mobile notifications for the channel
3. **Multiple Webhooks**: You can create multiple webhooks for different urgency levels
4. **Custom Avatar**: Upload a custom avatar for your webhook in Discord settings
