# Task: Integrate One by One

**ID**: task-20250802-214834-integrate-one-by-one
**Created**: 2025-08-02 21:48
**Status**: Active
**Assigned**: 2025-08-02
**Priority**: Medium

## Description

User requested "integrate one by one" - this appears to be a directive for incremental integration of components, features, or systems. The request lacks specific context about what needs to be integrated, so this task will focus on determining the integration requirements and implementing a systematic one-by-one integration approach.

## Expected Outcomes

1. **Clarify Integration Scope**: Determine what specific components/features need integration
2. **Integration Strategy**: Develop a systematic approach for one-by-one integration
3. **Implementation Plan**: Create step-by-step integration roadmap
4. **Execution**: Implement integrations incrementally with validation at each step

## Progress Log

- 2025-08-02 21:48 - Task created from ambiguous "integrate one by one" request
- 2025-08-02 21:48 - Task directory structure established with subfolders (notes/, code/, docs/, tests/)
- 2025-08-02 21:48 - Status set to Active, awaiting clarification of integration scope

## Next Steps

1. **Clarify Requirements**: Determine what specific systems/components need integration
2. **Analyze Current State**: Review existing codebase and integration points
3. **Plan Integration Sequence**: Define the order and methodology for one-by-one integration
4. **Begin Implementation**: Start systematic integration process

## Notes

- Request was ambiguous and requires clarification
- "One by one" suggests incremental approach is preferred
- May relate to testing, feature rollout, or system integration
- Awaiting additional context from user
