# Task: Implement Claude.md Agent Collaboration System

**ID**: task-20250802-142500-claude-agent-collaboration
**Created**: 2025-08-02 14:25
**Status**: In Progress
**Assigned**: 2025-08-02
**Priority**: High

## Description

Implement a comprehensive Claude.md agent collaboration system that enables specialized agents to work together on iterative document refinement. The system will provide a structured workflow for collaborative editing of the sacred CLAUDE.md document through multiple specialized views and checkpoint-based execution.

## Key Features to Implement

### 1. Claude-draft.md Working Layer
- Create a working draft system separate from the sacred CLAUDE.md
- Implement draft versioning and tracking
- Enable safe experimentation without affecting the production document

### 2. Checkpoint.md Micro-Task System
- Develop checkpoint system for granular task execution
- Track micro-task progress and completion
- Enable rollback and recovery mechanisms

### 3. Four Specialized UI Views
- **Ideation View**: Brainstorming and concept generation interface
- **Task Orchestration View**: Planning and workflow management
- **Execution View**: Real-time task monitoring and execution
- **Merge Review View**: Diff comparison and merge approval workflow

### 4. Diff/Merge Workflow
- Implement robust diff engine for document comparison
- Create merge conflict resolution interface
- Provide preview and approval mechanisms for changes

### 5. Specialized Agents
- **claude-ideation-agent**: Creative brainstorming and idea generation
- **claude-orchestration-agent**: Workflow planning and task coordination
- **claude-execution-agent**: Task execution and progress tracking
- **claude-merge-agent**: Document merging and conflict resolution

## Expected Outcomes

1. **Collaborative Framework**: Complete agent collaboration system
2. **Safe Iteration**: Non-destructive editing of sacred documents
3. **Workflow Management**: Structured approach to complex document updates
4. **Quality Control**: Review and approval mechanisms
5. **Specialized Expertise**: Domain-specific agents for different collaboration phases
